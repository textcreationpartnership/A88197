            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>ſts party at home offended? The Devill hath caſt a bone, and rais'd a conteſtation between the King and Parliament touching the <hi>Militia.</hi> His Majeſtic claims the diſpoſing of it to be in Him by the right of Law; The Parliament ſaith, <hi>Rebus ſic ſtantibus,</hi> and <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenti Rege,</hi> the ordering of it is in them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> VVHich Queſtion, may receive its ſolution by this diſtinction. That there is in Laws an equitable, and a litterall ſence. His Majeſty (let it be granted) is intruſted by Law with the <hi>Militia,</hi> but it's for the good and preſervation of the Republick, againſt Forraign Invaſions or domeſtick rebellions For it cannot be ſuppoſed that the <hi>Parliament</hi> would ever by Law intruſt the King with the <hi>Militia</hi> againſt themſelves, or the Common wealth, that intruſts them to provide for their weal, not for their wo. So that when there is certain appearance or grounded ſuſpition, that the Letter of the Law ſhall be improved againſt the <hi>equitie</hi> of it (that is, the publick good, whether of the body reall or repreſentative) then the Commander going againſt its <hi>equity,</hi> gives liberty to the Commanded to refuſe <hi>obedience</hi> to the Letter: for the Law taken abſtract from its originall reaſon and end, is made a ſhell without a kernell, a ſhadow without a ſubſtance, and a body without a ſoul. It is the execution of Laws according to their <hi>equity</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> which (as I may ſay) is the ſpirit that gives life to Authority the Letter kils.</p>
            <p>Nor need this <hi>equity</hi> be expreſſed in the Law, being ſo naturally implyed and ſuppoſed in all Laws that are not meerly Imperiall, from that analogie which all bodies Politick hold with the Naturalls whence all government and Governours borrow a proportionable reſpect; And therefore when the <hi>Militia</hi> of an Army is committed to the Generall, it is not with any expreſſe condition, that he ſhall not turn the mouths of his Cannons againſt his own Souldiers, for that is ſo naturally and neceſſarily implyed, that its needleſſe to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, inſomuch as if he did attempt or command ſuch a thing againſt the nature of his truſt and place, it did <hi>ipſo facto</hi> eſtate the Army in a right of diſobedience, except we think that obedience binds Men to cut their own throats, or at leaſt their companions.</p>
            <p>And indeed if this diſtinction be not allowed, then the legall and mixt <hi>Monarchy</hi> is the greateſt <hi>Tyranny,</hi> for if Laws inveſt the King in an abſolute power, and the Letter be not controled by the equity, then whereas other Kings that are abſolute <hi>Monarchs</hi> and rule by will, and not by Law, are <hi>Tyrants</hi> perforce. Thoſe that rule by Law and not by will, have hereby a <hi>Tyranny</hi> confer'd upon them legally, and ſo the very end of Laws, which is to give bounds and limits to the exorbitant wils of Princes, is by the Laws themſelves diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for they hereby give corroboration (and much more Juſtification) to an arbitrary <hi>Tyranny,</hi> by making it legall, not aſſumed; which Laws are ordained to croſſe not countenance: and therefore is the letter (where it ſeems abſolute) alwayes to receive qualification from the equity, elſe the foreſaid abſurdity muſt follow.</p>
            <p>It is confeſſed by all rationall men, that the <hi>Parliament</hi> hath a power to annull a Law, and to make a new Law, and to declare a Law, but known Laws in force and unrepealed by them, are a rule as long as they ſo remain for all the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England</hi> whereby to walk; and upon ra<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ionall grounds is conceived to be binding to the very <hi>Parliament</hi> themſelves as well as others. And though by their legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power they have Authority to make new Laws, yet no free man of <hi>England</hi> is to take notice (or can he) of what they intend till they declare it: neither can they, as is conceived, juſtly puniſh any man for walking cloſely to the known and declared Law, though it croſſe ſome pretended Priviledge of theirs, remaining onely in their own breaſts.</p>
            <p>For where there is no Law declared, there can be no tranſgreſſion; therefore it is verie requiſite that the <hi>Parliament</hi> would declare their Priviledges to the whole <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that ſo no man may through Jgnorance (by the <hi>Parl<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aments</hi> default) run cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly into the hazard of the leſſe of their lives, liberties, or eſtates: for here it is acknowledged by themſelves, that their power is limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe that be truſt them; and that they are not to do what they liſt, but what they ought, namely, to provide for the peoples weal, and not for their wo: ſo that unknown Priviledges are as dangerous, as unlimited Prerogatives, being both of them ſecret ſnares, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for the beſt affected people.</p>
            <p>It is the greateſt hazard and danger that can be run unto, to diſ<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rt the onely known and declared rule; the laying aſide whereof, brings in nothing but will and power, luſt and ſtrength, and ſo the ſtrongeſt to carrie all away; for it is the known, eſtabliſhed, declared, and unrepealed Law, that tels all the free men of <hi>England,</hi> that the Knights and Burgeſſes choſen according to Law, and ſent to make up the <hi>Parliament,</hi> are thoſe that all the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England</hi> (who ſend and chooſe them) are to obey.</p>
            <p>But take away this declared Law, and where will you find the rule of Obedience? and if there be no rule of obedience, then it muſt neceſſarily follow, that if a greater and ſtronger number come to a Parliament ſitting, and tell them that they are more and ſtronger then themſelves, and therefore they ſhall not make Laws for them, but they will rather make Laws for them, muſt they not needs give place? undoubtedly they muſt.</p>
            <p>Yea take away the declared, unrepealed Law, and then where is <hi>meum &amp; tuum,</hi> and libertie, and propertie? But you will ſay, the Law declared, binds the people, but is no rule for a Parliament ſitting, who are not to walk by a known Law. It is anſwered: It cannot be Imagined that ever the people would be ſo ſottiſh, as to give ſuch a power to thoſe whom they chooſe for their Servants; for this were to give them a power to provide for their wo, but not for their weal, which is contrary to their own foregoing maxime; therefore doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that man is upon the moſt ſolid and firm ground, that hath both the letter and <hi>equity</hi> of a known declared, and unrepealed Law on his ſide, though his practiſe do croſſe ſome pretended Priviledge of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas by an Act made this preſent <hi>Parliament, Anno 17 Caroli Regis,</hi> intituled,</p>
            <p>An Act for Regulating of the Privie Councell, and for taking away the Court, commonly called, The Star-Chamber.</p>
            <p>It is there declared, that the proceedings, Cenſures, and Decrees of the Star Chamber, have by experience been found to be an into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable burthen to the Subject, and the means to introduce an Arbitrary power and Government, and that the Councell-Table have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to determine of the eſtates, and liberties of the Subject, contrarie to the Law of the Land, and the rights and priviledges of the Subject. Which Laws are there recived, as firſt <hi>M<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Therefore for the Subjects good and welfare in future time, it is inacted, that from henceforth no Court, Councell, or place of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhall be erected, ordained, conſtituted, or appointed within this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> or dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> which ſhall have, uſe, or exerciſe the ſame, or the like juriſdiction, as is, or hath been uſed, practiſed, or exerciſed in the ſaid Court of Star-Chamber.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>equity</hi> and letter of which Law, it is deſired that our learned Lawyers would anſwer theſe inſuing <hi>Quaeries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, whether the letter and <hi>equity</hi> of this Law, do not bind the very Parliament themſelves during the time of their ſitting, in the like caſes here expreſſed to the ſame rules here laid down? Which if it ſhould be denied. Then ſecondly, whether the <hi>Parliament</hi> it ſelf, when it is ſitting, be not bound to the obſervation of the letter and <hi>equity</hi> of this Law, when they have to do with free-men, that in all their actions and expreſſions have declared faithfulneſſe to the Common-wealth? And if this be denied, Then</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whether ever God made any man lawleſſe? or whether ever the Common-wealth when they chooſe the Parliament, give them a lawles unlimited power, and at their pleaſure to walk contrary to their own Laws &amp; Ordinances before they have repealed them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, whether it be according to Law, Juſtice, or equity, for the Parliament to impriſon or puniſh a man for doing what they command him, and by oath injoyn him?</p>
            <p>Fiftly, whether it be legall, juſt, or equall, that when free-men do endeavour according to their duty, oath and Proteſtation, to give in information to the Parliament of Treaſon acted and done by Sir <hi>John Lenthall,</hi> againſt the State and Kingdom, and long ſince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to ſeverall Members of the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> but by them concealed and ſmothered; And now by Gods providence brought upon the ſtage again, and during the time that Inquiſition is made of it before the Committee of Examination, before any legall charge be fixed upon Sir <hi>John Lenthall,</hi> or he required to make any anſwer or defence, that he ſhall be preſent to out-face, diſcourage, and abuſe the Informers and witneſſes in the face of the Committee, without any check or controll from them?</p>
            <p>And ſometimes while they are ſitting about the Examination of his Treaſon, that he ſhall ſit down beſide them with his hat on, as if he were one of them, and that he ſhall injoy from the Committee ten times more favour and reſpect then the juſt, honeſt, and legall Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers againſt him; who by ſome of the Committee themſelves while they are ſitting, are threatned, jeered, nicknamed, and otherwayes moſt ſhamefully abuſed.</p>
            <p>Yea and the friends of the Informers for the State are kept without doors, and the friends of the accuſed admitted to come in alwaies without controll; and during the Examination of the Information, that the Committee ſhall refuſe to remove the Informers out of Sir <hi>John Lenthals</hi> cuſtody of Kings Bench to another priſon, although they have been truly informed, that he hath ſet Inſtruments on work to murther them, and alſo importuned to remove them.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, whether it be not moſt agreeable to Law, Juſtice, and equitie, that ſeeing Sir <hi>John Lenthall</hi> having ſo many friends in the Houſe concerned in the buſines, that he ſhould not rather be tried by the ſame Councell of Warre in London, where Sir <hi>John Hotha<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
